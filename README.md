# Agent-based-model-of-human-mobility-in-urban-environment

In the context of this diploma thesis, the topic of human mobility patterns is studied and the way that it can be simulated through Agent Based Modeling.

An observer, when looking at random people moving in the streets, would have a first impression that the paths that they follow are seemingly random. Studies of human mobility patterns prove the exact opposite. People's movement, although it may seem random, is in fact limited by several factors and is to some extent predictable. Indeed, if one thinks about it, the concept of routine plays a dominant role in people's lives, and this has consequences for the course they follow. For example, a large percentage of people have a place of interest (be it a job, school, university, etc.) and as a result, each person often travels between that place and his/her house.

Such situations are easy to simulate with the Agent Based Modeling method. Through it, every human being is represented as an agent within the simulation environment. Such an experiment examines the interactions both agents have with each other and with the environment. In this way Emergence phenomena occur, that is, properties are observed in the whole and not in humans as independent entities.

One application of the above is to simulate the movement of people in a city environment, and in particular to find a lost child. The last part of the diploma thesis presents the elements and modeling of such an experiment.
